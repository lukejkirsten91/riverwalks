# Riverwalks - Project Status & Documentation

## 🎯 Project Overview
Riverwalks is a web application designed primarily for GCSE Geography students to document river studies and generate professional coursework reports. The platform allows users to log river walks and conduct detailed site measurements with advanced visualization and analysis tools.

## 🚀 Live Application
- **Production URL**: https://riverwalks.vercel.app
- **Current Status**: ✅ Fully functional River Walk CRUD with authentication

## 🏗️ Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with React 18
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.3.0 + shadcn/ui components
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with Google OAuth
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Row Level Security
- **Deployment**: Vercel with continuous deployment from GitHub
- **Repository**: https://github.com/lukejkirsten91/riverwalks

## 📊 Current Features (Completed)

### ✅ Authentication System
- Google OAuth integration via Supabase
- Session management with persistent login
- Secure user profile display
- OAuth callback handling for all domains

### ✅ River Walk Management (Full CRUD)
- **Create**: Add new river walks with form validation
- **Read**: View all user's river walks, sorted by date (newest first)
- **Update**: Edit existing river walks inline
- **Delete**: Remove river walks with confirmation dialog
- **Fields**: Name, Date, Country (default: UK), County (optional)

### ✅ User Experience
- Clear login status indicator ("✓ Logged in as [email]")
- Navigation between home and river-walks pages
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Error handling and loading states
- Google logo on sign-in button

### ✅ Security & Data Isolation
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
- Users can only see/modify their own river walks
- Automatic user_id assignment on creation
- Secure API endpoints with authentication checks

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### river_walks table
```sql
CREATE TABLE river_walks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  country TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'UK',
  county TEXT,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### RLS Policies
- Users can SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE only their own river walks
- All operations filtered by `auth.uid() = user_id`

## 🔧 Configuration Required

### Environment Variables (.env.local)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Supabase Setup
1. **OAuth Configuration**: Google OAuth enabled with proper redirect URLs
2. **Database**: Run `supabase/cleanup.sql` to create tables and RLS policies
3. **Authentication**: Users table automatically managed by Supabase Auth

### Google Cloud Console
- OAuth 2.0 client configured for Supabase redirect URLs
- Authorized domains include Vercel deployment URLs

## 🎭 User Flow
1. User visits https://riverwalks.vercel.app
2. Clicks "Sign In with Google" (with Google logo)
3. Completes OAuth flow, redirected to `/river-walks`
4. Sees "✓ Logged in as [email]" indicator
5. Can add/edit/delete river walks
6. Data persists between sessions
7. Can navigate home or sign out

## 🚀 Next Phase: GCSE River Study Integration

### 📊 Streamlit App Analysis (app.py)
A comprehensive Streamlit application exists with the following features:
- **Multi-site measurement input**: Width and depth measurements across multiple river sections
- **Real-time visualization**: 2D cross-sections with live preview as data is entered
- **3D river profile**: Professional 3D visualization with realistic banks and terrain
- **Data export**: CSV download functionality for coursework submission
- **GCSE-focused interface**: Designed specifically for Geography student needs

### 🛠️ Integration Plan (4-Phase Approach)

**Phase 1: Sites Foundation** 
- Add Sites data model to existing River Walks
- Create basic site input forms within river walk details  
- Implement measurement points storage in Supabase
- Simple data display without visualizations

**Phase 2: 2D Visualization**
- Integrate Plotly.js for client-side charts
- Implement 2D cross-section visualizations  
- Add measurement point editing capabilities
- Data validation and error handling

**Phase 3: Advanced Features**
- 3D river profile visualization (matching Streamlit quality)
- Professional report generation (PDF export)
- CSV/Excel export functionality
- Print-friendly layouts for GCSE coursework

**Phase 4: GCSE Enhancement**
- AI-generated river analysis descriptions
- Educational templates and guidance text
- Calculation helpers (flow rate, wetted perimeter, etc.)
- Comparison tools between different river walks

### 🗄️ Planned Database Extensions

```sql
-- Sites table (extends river_walks)
CREATE TABLE sites (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  river_walk_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES river_walks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  site_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  site_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  river_width DECIMAL(8,2) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Measurement points within each site  
CREATE TABLE measurement_points (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  site_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES sites(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  point_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  distance_from_bank DECIMAL(8,2) NOT NULL,
  depth DECIMAL(8,2) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 🎯 Target Users (Updated)
- **Primary**: GCSE Geography students creating coursework
- **Secondary**: Teachers and educators  
- **Tertiary**: General river enthusiasts and citizen scientists

### 💡 Key Value Propositions
- Professional coursework-ready reports with charts and analysis
- No software installation required - fully web-based
- Cloud-based data persistence across sessions
- Export capabilities for assignment submission
- Educational guidance and GCSE-specific templates

### 🔄 Implementation Strategy
- **Rollback-friendly**: Each phase on separate feature branches
- **Incremental testing**: Deploy and test each phase on main before proceeding
- **User feedback**: Test with GCSE students/teachers during development
- **Performance focus**: Ensure visualizations work well on school devices

### 📚 Technical Dependencies (Planned)
```json
{
  "plotly.js": "^2.26.0",
  "react-plotly.js": "^2.6.0", 
  "jspdf": "^2.5.1",
  "html2canvas": "^1.4.1",
  "papaparse": "^5.4.1"
}
```

## 🚨 Known Issues & Limitations
- Preview deployments may have OAuth redirect issues (resolved by using main branch)
- Streamlit app.py functionality not yet integrated into web app
- No measurement sites or visualization features yet
- No report generation or data export beyond basic CSV

## 🔄 Git Branches
- **main**: Production-ready code, deployed to Vercel
- **feature/river-walks-crud**: Development branch (merged to main)
- **temp/clean-river-walks**: Rollback point before CRUD implementation

### 🚀 Planned Feature Branches
- **feature/sites-basic**: Phase 1 - Basic site management and measurement input
- **feature/visualization**: Phase 2 - 2D charts and cross-section visualization
- **feature/3d-profile**: Phase 3 - 3D river profile and report generation
- **feature/gcse-enhancement**: Phase 4 - AI analysis and educational features

## 📝 Development Notes for Future Sessions

### When Starting New Sessions:
1. Read this PROJECT_STATUS.md file first
2. Check current branch and recent commits
3. Verify Supabase connection and table structure
4. Test live application at https://riverwalks.vercel.app
5. Review app.py Streamlit functionality for integration context

### Common Tasks:
- **Add new features**: Create feature branch, implement, test, merge to main
- **Database changes**: Update `supabase/cleanup.sql` and run in Supabase dashboard
- **UI changes**: Use existing shadcn/ui components and Tailwind classes
- **Deployment**: Push to main branch triggers automatic Vercel deployment

### Code Conventions:
- React functional components with hooks
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Error handling with try/catch and user feedback
- Supabase client for all database operations
- Next.js file-based routing
