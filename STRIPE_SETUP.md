# Stripe Payment System Setup Guide

Complete guide for implementing Stripe payments in Riverwalks with voucher system, GDPR compliance, and subscription management.

## üéØ Overview

This setup implements:
- **Two subscription plans**: ¬£1.99/year and ¬£3.50 lifetime
- **Voucher system**: Discounts up to 100% with admin management
- **GDPR compliance**: Data export, account deletion, user rights
- **Legal transparency**: Clear terms, easy cancellation, refund policies
- **Security**: PCI compliance through Stripe, secure data handling

## üöÄ 1. Stripe Account Setup

### Create Stripe Account

1. **Sign up for Stripe** at https://stripe.com
2. Choose **United Kingdom** as your country
3. Complete business verification with:
   - Business details (sole trader or limited company)
   - Bank account details for payouts
   - ID verification documents

### Configure Tax Settings

1. Navigate to **Settings ‚Üí Tax**
2. Enable **UK VAT** if applicable
3. Set up **automatic tax calculation**
4. Configure **VAT rates** for digital services

### Set Up Products and Prices

1. Go to **Products** in Stripe Dashboard
2. Create two products:

**Product 1: Riverwalks Annual Subscription**
- Name: "Riverwalks Annual Subscription"
- Description: "Access to Riverwalks for GCSE Geography students - 1 year"
- Price: ¬£1.99 GBP (one-time payment, not recurring)

**Product 2: Riverwalks Lifetime Access**
- Name: "Riverwalks Lifetime Access" 
- Description: "Lifetime access to Riverwalks for GCSE Geography students"
- Price: ¬£3.50 GBP (one-time payment)

> **Note**: We use one-time payments instead of subscriptions to simplify billing and cancellation for students.

## üîê 2. Environment Variables Setup

Add these variables to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Existing Supabase variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... # Use sk_live_... for production
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_... # Use pk_live_... for production
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... # From webhook endpoint setup

# Optional: Google Maps (if not already set)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_key
```

### Getting Stripe Keys

1. **Publishable Key**: Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí API keys ‚Üí Publishable key
2. **Secret Key**: Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí API keys ‚Üí Secret key (click "Reveal")
3. **Webhook Secret**: Set up webhook first (see step 4), then copy signing secret

## üóÑÔ∏è 3. Database Setup

Run the subscription system migration in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Execute the file: supabase/add-subscription-system.sql
-- This creates all tables, RLS policies, and functions
```

The migration creates:
- `subscriptions` table with Stripe integration
- `vouchers` table with admin management
- `voucher_usage` tracking for analytics
- `payment_events` audit trail for compliance
- `gdpr_requests` for data subject rights
- Helper functions for subscription validation

## üîó 4. Webhook Configuration

### Create Webhook Endpoint

1. Go to **Developers ‚Üí Webhooks** in Stripe Dashboard
2. Click **Add endpoint**
3. Set URL: `https://riverwalks.co.uk/api/stripe/webhook`
4. Select events to listen for:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`

### Configure Webhook Secret

1. Copy the **Signing secret** from the webhook endpoint
2. Add it to your environment variables as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## üí≥ 5. Test the Integration

### Test Cards (Development)

Use these test cards in development:

```
Successful payment: 4242 4242 4242 4242
Declined payment: 4000 0000 0000 0002
Requires 3D Secure: 4000 0000 0000 3220
```

### Test Workflow

1. **Create test voucher**: Use admin interface to create test vouchers
2. **Test payment flow**: Try both annual and lifetime plans
3. **Test voucher validation**: Apply discount codes during checkout
4. **Test webhook handling**: Verify payments are recorded in database
5. **Test subscription status**: Check user dashboard shows correct status

## üé´ 6. Voucher System

### Pre-created Vouchers

The migration includes three test vouchers:
- `LAUNCH50`: 50% off (100 uses)
- `TEACHER100`: 100% off for teachers (50 uses)
- `FREEYEAR`: Free first year - ¬£1.99 off (25 uses)

### Creating New Vouchers

Use the admin API endpoint `/api/admin/vouchers`:

```javascript
// Example: Create 75% off voucher for beta testers
const voucher = {
  code: "BETA75",
  discountType: "percentage",
  discountValue: 75,
  maxUses: 200,
  validUntil: "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z",
  planTypes: ["yearly", "lifetime"],
  newUsersOnly: true,
  description: "75% off for beta testers",
  internalNotes: "Marketing campaign Q4 2024"
};
```

### Voucher Management Features

- **Revenue impact**: Track total discounts given
- **User restrictions**: New users only or all users
- **Plan restrictions**: Apply to specific subscription plans
- **Expiry dates**: Time-limited promotions
