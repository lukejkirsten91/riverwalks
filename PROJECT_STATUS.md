- **Prettier formatting**: Consistent code style across the project
- **Build verification**: TypeScript compilation passes without errors

### ✅ Component Modularization & Architecture

- **Separation of concerns**: Clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data access
- **Custom hooks**: Business logic extracted into reusable hooks (`useRiverWalks`, `useSites`, `useMeasurements`)
- **Modular components**: Large monolithic component broken into focused, single-responsibility components
- **Component structure**: Organized under `components/river-walks/` with proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Maintainable codebase**: Improved readability, testability, and future extensibility

### ✅ Mobile-First Responsive Design

- **Mobile-first approach**: All components designed for mobile screens first, then enhanced for larger screens
- **Touch-friendly interface**: Larger buttons (44px+ touch targets) with `touch-manipulation` CSS
- **Responsive breakpoints**: Tailwind CSS breakpoints (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:) used throughout
- **Flexible layouts**: Components stack vertically on mobile, flow horizontally on desktop
- **Optimized modals**: Site management modal adapts to small screens with proper scrolling
- **Form improvements**: Grid layouts for better mobile form experience
- **Button layouts**: Stacked buttons on mobile, horizontal on desktop

### ✅ Sites Management (Phase 1 - COMPLETED)

- **Database Schema**: Sites and measurement_points tables with full RLS
- **Site Creation**: Add sites to river walks with name and width
- **Sites Listing**: View all sites for a river walk in modal interface
- **Basic UI**: Clean modal interface with form validation
- **API Layer**: Complete CRUD operations for sites management

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### river_walks table

```sql
CREATE TABLE river_walks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  country TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'UK',
  county TEXT,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### sites table (Phase 1)

```sql
CREATE TABLE sites (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  river_walk_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES river_walks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  site_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  site_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  river_width DECIMAL(8,2) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### measurement_points table (Phase 1)

```sql
CREATE TABLE measurement_points (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  site_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES sites(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  point_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  distance_from_bank DECIMAL(8,2) NOT NULL,
  depth DECIMAL(8,2) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### RLS Policies

- Users can SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE only their own river walks
- Sites and measurement points inherit user access through river_walks relationship
- All operations filtered by `auth.uid() = user_id`

## 🔧 Configuration Required

### Environment Variables (.env.local)

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Supabase Setup

1. **OAuth Configuration**: Google OAuth enabled with proper redirect URLs
2. **Database**:
   - Run `supabase/cleanup.sql` to create river_walks table and RLS policies
   - Run `supabase/sites-schema.sql` to create sites and measurement_points tables
3. **Authentication**: Users table automatically managed by Supabase Auth

### Google Cloud Console

- OAuth 2.0 client configured for Supabase redirect URLs
- Authorized domains include Vercel deployment URLs

## 🎭 User Flow

1. User visits https://riverwalks.vercel.app
2. Clicks "Sign In with Google" (with Google logo)
3. Completes OAuth flow, redirected to `/river-walks`
4. Sees "✓ Logged in as [email]" indicator
5. Can add/edit/delete river walks
6. Data persists between sessions
7. Can navigate home or sign out

## 🚀 Next Phase: GCSE River Study Integration

### 📊 Streamlit App Analysis (app.py)

A comprehensive Streamlit application exists with the following features:

- **Multi-site measurement input**: Width and depth measurements across multiple river sections

- Professional report generation (PDF export)
- CSV/Excel export functionality
- Print-friendly layouts for GCSE coursework

**Phase 4: GCSE Enhancement**

- AI-generated river analysis descriptions
- Educational templates and guidance text
- Calculation helpers (flow rate, wetted perimeter, etc.)
- Comparison tools between different river walks

### 🗄️ Planned Database Extensions

```sql
-- Sites table (extends river_walks)
CREATE TABLE sites (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  river_walk_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES river_walks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  site_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  site_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  river_width DECIMAL(8,2) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Measurement points within each site
CREATE TABLE measurement_points (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  site_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES sites(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  point_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  distance_from_bank DECIMAL(8,2) NOT NULL,
  depth DECIMAL(8,2) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 🎯 Target Users (Updated)

- **Primary**: GCSE Geography students creating coursework
- **Secondary**: Teachers and educators
- **Tertiary**: General river enthusiasts and citizen scientists

### 💡 Key Value Propositions

- Professional coursework-ready reports with charts and analysis
- No software installation required - fully web-based
- Cloud-based data persistence across sessions
- Export capabilities for assignment submission
- Educational guidance and GCSE-specific templates

### 🔄 Implementation Strategy

- **Rollback-friendly**: Each phase on separate feature branches
- **Incremental testing**: Deploy and test each phase on main before proceeding
- **User feedback**: Test with GCSE students/teachers during development
- **Performance focus**: Ensure visualizations work well on school devices

### 🎯 **MANDATORY PRINCIPLES FOR ALL FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:**

**1. Separation of Concerns (Always Apply):**

- Presentation components should only handle UI rendering
- Business logic must be extracted into custom hooks
- Data access should remain in dedicated API layer functions
- Never mix these concerns in the same file/component

**2. Mobile-First Responsive Design (Non-Negotiable):**

- Design and code for mobile screens first, then enhance for larger screens
- All interactive elements must have 44px+ touch targets
- Use responsive breakpoints consistently: `sm:` (640px+), `md:` (768px+), `lg:` (1024px+), `xl:` (1280px+)
- Test all new features on mobile devices/responsive design tools
- Stack content vertically on mobile, flow horizontally on desktop

**3. Component Modularization (Required):**

- Break down large components into smaller, focused pieces
- Each component should have a single, clear responsibility
- Reusable components should be properly abstracted
- Avoid monolithic components with multiple concerns

**4. TypeScript Best Practices (Enforced):**

- All new code must use proper TypeScript with strict mode
- Define interfaces for all props, data structures, and API responses
- Use proper typing for event handlers and function parameters
- Leverage TypeScript for better developer experience and error catching

**5. User Experience Priority:**

- Prioritize GCSE student needs (primary users)
- Ensure accessibility and ease of use on school devices
- Maintain consistent, intuitive user interface patterns
- Focus on functionality that serves educational purposes

### 📚 Technical Dependencies (Planned)

```json
{
  "plotly.js": "^2.26.0",
  "react-plotly.js": "^2.6.0",
  "jspdf": "^2.5.1",
  "html2canvas": "^1.4.1",
  "papaparse": "^5.4.1"
}
```
